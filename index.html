            <p class="center">Hi, I'm John Michael (yes, I have two first names!). I am an aspiring software engineer interested in web development and distributed computing. I am starting
                at Amazon in March 2019 as a software development engineer and I could not be more excited. I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a passionate coder and technologist that is always hungry to learn more. I am a fairly heavy Java user, but am also proficient with Python,
                Javascript, and C++, and enjoy frameworks such as Spring Boot, Django, Express for server-side development. I am playing around with React a bit
                in order to be able to have a wholistic understanding of the modern web stack from top-to-bottom. I am currently focusing on learning more about
                operating systems and distributed systems, and hope to complete serveral Coursera courses on these subjects in the coming months.
            </p>
            <p>Check out my github for a detailed look at some of my projects. I've built projects ranging across
                a variety of fields in computer science, including web development, natural language processing, networking,
                and operating systems. For example, I performed <a href="https://github.com/jmkovachi/sent-classifer">NLP research on the effects of 
                    financial news on the stock market</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmkovachi/Bookstore">built a fully functioning e-commerce website</a>, and 
                <a href="https://github.com/jmkovachi/Unix-Shell">implemented over a dozen of the most useful UNIX utilities from scratch</a>. These are just some examples 
                of the stuff I'm interested in, and I'm always trying to contribute more. My next goal is to complete a React Native project I've been excited about for quite a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of software, I enjoy soccer (go Gunners!), traveling (I expect to travel to Asia in early 2019), and listening to music. I am currently
                trying to learn piano, but have had to take a break because of an intense school semester. Thankfully, I will be able to focus on piano consistently
                now that I am almost graduated (hooray!).
